Its a Node.js app with Express as the main framework, and TypeScript. Application is runing on Port 7000, but can be set in .env file.

After cloning the repository open terminal run ```npm install``` and ```npm run dev```

This application uses local storage as database, with help of fs library. In future can be replaced with actual database(simply replacing .database.ts files).
